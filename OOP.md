# OOP

- Start with the nouns (objects), then add the verbs(behaviors or methods)
- A Class is the code-template for creating objects
- 

# Definitions

| Term                     | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class**                | A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation. |
| **Class variable**       | A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.                     |
| **Data member**          | A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Function overloading** | The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.                                                                                    |
| **Instance variable**    | A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Inheritance**          | The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Instance**             | An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.                                                                                             |
| **Instantiation**        | The creation of an instance of a class.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Method**               | A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Object**               | A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.                                                                     |
| **Operator overloading** | The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.                                                                                                                                                                  |
